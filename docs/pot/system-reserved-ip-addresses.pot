For example, suppose the System Reserved IP range starts at 192.168.154.2 and ends at 192.168.154.7. &PRODUCT; can use .2 to .7 for System VMs. This leaves the rest of the pod CIDR, from .8 to .254, for the Management Server and hypervisor hosts."

msgid "When advanced networking is being used, the number of private IP addresses available in each pod varies depending on which hypervisor is running on the nodes in that pod. Citrix XenServer and KVM use link-local addresses, which in theory provide more than 65,000 private IP addresses within the address block. As the pod grows over time, this should be more than enough for any reasonable number of hosts as well as IP addresses for guest virtual routers. VMWare ESXi, by contrast uses any administrator-specified subnetting scheme, and the typical administrator provides only 255 IPs per pod. Since these are shared by physical machines, the guest virtual router, and other entities, it is possible to run out of private IPs when scaling up a pod whose nodes are running ESXi."
