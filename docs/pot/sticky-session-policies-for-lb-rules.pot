msgid "Sticky sessions are used in Web-based applications to ensure continued availability of information across the multiple requests in a user's session. For example, if a shopper is filling a cart, you need to remember what has been purchased so far. The concept of \"stickiness\" is also referred to as persistence or maintaining state."

msgid "Any load balancer rule defined in &PRODUCT; can have a stickiness policy. The policy consists of a name, stickiness method, and parameters. The parameters are name-value pairs or flags, which are defined by the load balancer vendor. The stickiness method could be load balancer-generated cookie, application-generated cookie, or source-based. In the source-based method, the source IP address is used to identify the user and locate the userâ€™s stored data. In the other methods, cookies are used. The cookie generated by the load balancer or application is included in request and response URLs to create persistence. The cookie name can be specified by the administrator or automatically generated. A variety of options are provided to control the exact behavior of cookies, such as how they are generated and whether they are cached."
