msgid "A cluster provides a way to group hosts. To be precise, a cluster is a XenServer server pool, a set of KVM servers, , or a VMware cluster preconfigured in vCenter. The hosts in a cluster all have identical hardware, run the same hypervisor, are on the same subnet, and access the same shared primary storage. Virtual machine instances (VMs) can be live-migrated from one host to another within the same cluster, without interrupting service to the user."
