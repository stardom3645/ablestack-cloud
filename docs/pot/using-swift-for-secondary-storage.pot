msgid "&PRODUCT; supports OpenStack Object Storage (<ulink url=\"http://swift.openstack.org/\"> Swift</ulink>) for secondary storage. When using Swift, you configure Swift storage for the entire &PRODUCT;, then set up NFS secondary storage for each zone as usual. The NFS storage in each zone acts as a staging area through which all templates and other secondary storage data pass before being forwarded to Swift. The Swift storage acts as a cloud-wide resource, making templates and other data available to any zone in the cloud. There is no hierarchy in the Swift storage, just one Swift container per storage object. Any secondary storage in the whole cloud can pull a container from Swift at need. It is not necessary to copy templates and snapshots from one zone to another, as would be required when using zone NFS alone. Everything is available everywhere"

msgid "Swift storage must be set up before you add NFS secondary storage to zones. This is accomplished through some additional configuration steps on a fresh Management Server installation, before you add the first zone. The procedure is described in Adding a Zone in the Advanced Installation Guide."
