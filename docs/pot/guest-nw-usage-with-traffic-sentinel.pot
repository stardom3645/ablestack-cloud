msgid "Traffic Sentinel is a network traffic usage data collection package. &PRODUCT; can feed statistics from Traffic Sentinel into its own usage records, providing a basis for billing users of cloud infrastructure. Traffic Sentinel uses the traffic monitoring protocol sFlow. Routers and switches generate sFlow records and provide them for collection by Traffic Sentinel, then &PRODUCT; queries the Traffic Sentinel database to obtain this information"

msgid "To construct the query, &PRODUCT; determines what guest IPs were in use during the current query interval. This includes both newly assigned IPs and IPs that were assigned in a previous time period and continued to be in use. &PRODUCT; queries Traffic Sentinel for network statistics that apply to these IPs during the time period they remained allocated in &PRODUCT;. The returned data is correlated with the customer account that owned each IP and the timestamps when IPs were assigned and released in order to create billable metering records in &PRODUCT;. When the Usage Server runs, it collects this data."
