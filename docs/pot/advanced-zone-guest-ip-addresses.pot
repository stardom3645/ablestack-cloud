msgid "When advanced networking is used, the administrator can create additional networks for use by the guests. These networks can span the zone and be available to all accounts, or they can be scoped to a single account, in which case only the named account may create guests that attach to these networks. The networks are defined by a VLAN ID, IP range, and gateway. The administrator may provision thousands of these networks if desired."
