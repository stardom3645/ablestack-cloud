msgid "Guest. When end users run VMs, they generate guest traffic. The guest VMs communicate with each other over a network that can be referred to as the guest network. Each pod in a basic zone is a broadcast domain, and therefore each pod has a different IP range for the guest network. The administrator must configure the IP range for each pod."

msgid "Management. When &PRODUCT;â€™s internal resources communicate with each other, they generate management traffic. This includes communication between hosts, system VMs (VMs used by &PRODUCT; to perform various tasks in the cloud), and any other component that communicates directly with the &PRODUCT; Management Server. You must configure the IP range for the system VMs to use."

msgid "Public. Public traffic is generated when VMs in the cloud access the Internet. Publicly accessible IPs must be allocated for this purpose. End users can use the &PRODUCT; UI to acquire these IPs to implement NAT between their guest network and the public network, as described in Acquiring a New IP Address."

msgid "Storage. Traffic such as VM templates and snapshots, which is sent between the secondary storage VM and secondary storage servers. &PRODUCT; uses a separate Network Interface Controller (NIC) named storage NIC for storage network traffic. Use of a storage NIC that always operates on a high bandwidth network allows fast template and snapshot copying. You must configure the IP range to use for the storage network."

msgid "In a basic network, configuring the physical network is fairly straightforward. In most cases, you only need to configure one guest network to carry traffic that is generated by guest VMs. If you use a NetScaler load balancer and enable its elastic IP and elastic load balancing (EIP and ELB) features, you must also configure a network to carry public traffic. &PRODUCT; takes care of presenting the necessary network configuration steps to you in the UI when you add a new zone."
