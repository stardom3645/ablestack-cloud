msgid "A layer-3 switching layer is at the core of the data center. A router redundancy protocol like VRRP should be deployed. Typically high-end core switches also include firewall modules. Separate firewall appliances may also be used if the layer-3 switch does not have integrated firewall capabilities. The firewalls are configured in NAT mode. The firewalls provide the following functions:"
