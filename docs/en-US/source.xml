<chapter id="sect-source">
    <title>Building from Source</title>
    <para>The official &PRODUCT; release is always in source code form. You will likely be able to find "convenience binaries," the source is the canonical release. In this section, we'll cover acquiring the source release and building that so that you can deploy it using Maven or create Debian packages or RPMs.</para>
    <para>Note that building and deploying directly from source is typically not the most efficient way to deploy an IaaS. However, we will cover that method as well as building RPMs or Debian packages for deploying &PRODUCT;.</para>
    <para>The instructions here are likely version-specific. That is, the method for building from source for the 4.0.x series is different from the 4.1.x series.</para>
    <para>If you are working with a unreleased version of &PRODUCT;, see the INSTALL.md file in the top-level directory of the release.</para>
