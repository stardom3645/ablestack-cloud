    <title>About Private VLAN</title>
    <para>In an Ethernet switch, a VLAN is a broadcast domain in which hosts can establish direct
      communication with each another at Layer 2. Private VLAN is designed as an extension of VLAN
      standard to add further segmentation of the logical broadcast domain. A regular VLAN is a
      single broadcast domain, whereas a private VLAN partitions a larger VLAN broadcast domain into
      smaller sub-domains. A sub-domain is represented by a pair of VLANs: a Primary VLAN and a
      Secondary VLAN.  The original VLAN that is being divided into smaller groups is called
      Primary, That implies all VLAN pairs in a private VLAN share the same Primary VLAN. All the
      secondary VLANs exist only inside the Primary. Each Secondary VLAN has a specific VLAN ID
      associated to it, which differentiates one sub-domain from another.</para>
