  <title>Isolation in Advanced Zone Using Private VLAN</title>
  <para>Isolation of guest traffic in shared networks can be achieved by using Private VLANs
    (PVLAN). PVLANs provide Layer 2 isolation between ports within the same VLAN. In a PVLAN-enabled
    shared network, a user VM cannot reach other user VM though they can reach the DHCP server and
    gateway, this would in turn allow users to control traffic within a network and help them deploy
    multiple applications without communication between application as well as prevent communication
    with other usersâ€™ VMs.</para>

    <title>About Private VLAN</title>
    <para>In an Ethernet switch, a VLAN is a broadcast domain where hosts can establish direct
      communication with each another at Layer 2. Private VLAN is designed as an extension of VLAN
      standard to add further segmentation of the logical broadcast domain. A regular VLAN is a
      single broadcast domain, whereas a private VLAN partitions a larger VLAN broadcast domain into
      smaller sub-domains. A sub-domain is represented by a pair of VLANs: a Primary VLAN and a
      Secondary VLAN. The original VLAN that is being divided into smaller groups is called Primary,
      which implies that all VLAN pairs in a private VLAN share the same Primary VLAN. All the
      secondary VLANs exist only inside the Primary. Each Secondary VLAN has a specific VLAN ID
      associated to it, which differentiates one sub-domain from another. </para>
    <para>Three types of ports exist in a private VLAN domain, which essentially determine the
      behaviour of the participating hosts. Each ports will have its own unique set of rules, which
      regulate a connected host's ability to communicate with other connected host within the same
      private VLAN domain. Configure each host that is part of a PVLAN pair can be by using one of
      these three port designation:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Promiscuous</emphasis>: A promiscuous port can communicate with
          all the interfaces, including the community and isolated host ports that belong to the
          secondary VLANs. In Promiscuous mode, hosts are connected to promiscuous ports and are
          able to communicate directly with resources on both primary and secondary VLAN. Routers,
          DHCP servers, and other trusted devices are typically attached to promiscuous
          ports.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Isolated VLANs</emphasis>: The ports within an isolated VLAN
          cannot communicate with each other at the layer-2 level. The hosts that are connected to
          Isolated ports can directly communicate only with the Promiscuous resources. If your
          customer device needs to have access only to a gateway router, attach it to an isolated
          port.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Community VLANs</emphasis>: The ports within a community VLAN
          can communicate with each other and with the promiscuous ports, but they cannot
          communicate with the ports in other communities at the layer-2 level. In a Community mode,
          direct communication is permitted only with the hosts in the same community and those that
          are connected to the Primary PVLAN in promiscuous mode. If your customer has two devices
          that need to be isolated from other customers' devices, but to be able to communicate
          among themselves, deploy them in community ports.</para>
