  <title>Creating Egress Firewall Rules in an Advanced Zone</title>
  <note>
    <para>The egress firewall rules are supported only on virtual routers.</para>
  </note>
  <para/>
  <para>The egress traffic originates from a private network to a public network, such as the
    Internet. By default, the egress traffic is blocked, so no outgoing traffic is allowed from a
    guest network to the Internet. However, you can control the egress traffic in an Advanced zone
    by creating egress firewall rules. When an egress firewall rule is applied, the traffic specific
    to the rule is allowed and the remaining traffic is blocked. When all the firewall rules are
    removed the default policy, Block, is applied.</para>
  <para>Consider the following scenarios to apply egress firewall rules:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Allow the egress traffic from specified source CIDR. The Source CIDR is part of guest
        network CIDR.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Allow the egress traffic with destination protocol TCP,UDP,ICMP, or ALL.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Allow the egress traffic with destination protocol and port range. The port range is
        specified for TCP, UDP or for ICMP type and code.</para>

      <para>To add an egress rule, click the Egress rules tab and fill out the following fields to
        specify what type of traffic is allowed to be sent out of VM instances in this guest

            the IP addresses within a particular address block, enter a CIDR or a comma-separated
            list of CIDRs. The CIDR is the base IP address of the destination. For example,
            192.168.0.0/22. To allow all CIDRs, set to 0.0.0.0/0.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">Protocol</emphasis>: The networking protocol that VMs uses to
            send outgoing traffic. The TCP and UDP protocols are typically used for data exchange

            or network monitoring data.</para>
