  <title>Egress Firewall Rules in an Advanced Zone</title>
  <para>The egress traffic originates from a private network to a public network, such as the
    Internet. By default, the egress traffic is blocked, so no outgoing traffic is allowed from a
    guest network to the Internet. However, you can control the egress traffic in an Advanced zone
    by creating egress firewall rules. When an egress firewall rule is applied, the traffic specific
    to the rule is allowed and the remaining traffic is blocked. When all the firewall rules are
    removed the default policy, Block, is applied.</para>
  <para>Egress firewall rules are supported on Juniper SRX and virtual router.</para>
  <note>
    <para>The egress firewall rules are not supported on shared networks.</para>
  </note>
  <para>Consider the following scenarios to apply egress firewall rules:</para>

    <title>Changing the Default Egress Policy</title>
    <para>You can configure the default policy of egress firewall rules in Isolated Advanced
      networks. Use the create network offering option to determine whether the default policy
      should be block or allow all the traffic to the public network from a guest network. If no
      policy is specified, by default all the traffic is allowed from the guest network that you
      create by using this network offering.</para>
    <para>You have two options: Allow and Deny.</para>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Allow</title>
      <para>If you select Allow for a network offering, by default egress traffic is allowed.
        However, when an egress rule is configured for a guest network, rules are applied to block
        the specified traffic and rest are allowed. If no egress rules are configured for the
        network, egress traffic is accepted.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Deny</title>
      <para>If you select Deny for a network offering, by default egress traffic for the guest
        network is blocked. However, when an egress rules is configured for a guest network, rules
        are applied to allow the specified traffic. While implementing a guest network, &PRODUCT;
        adds the firewall egress rule specific to the default egress policy for the guest
        network.</para>
