  <title>Adding a Private Gateway to a VPC</title>
  <para>A private gateway can be added by the root admin only. The VPC private network has 1:1
    relationship with the NIC of the physical network. You can configure multiple private gateways
    to a single VPC. No gateways with duplicated VLAN and IP are allowed in the same data
    center.</para>

    <title>Source NAT on Private Gateway</title>
    <para>You might want to deploy multiple VPCs with the same super CIDR and guest tier CIDR.
      Therefore, multiple guest VMs from different VPCs can have the same IPs to reach a enterprise
      data center through the private gateway. In such cases, a NAT service need to be configured on
      the private gateway. If Source NAT is enabled, the guest VMs in VPC reaches the enterprise
      network via private gateway IP address by using the NAT service. </para>
    <para>The Source NAT service on a private gateway can be enabled while adding the private
      gateway. On deletion of a private gateway, source NAT rules specific to the private gateway
      are deleted.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="acl-private-gateway">
    <title>ACL on Private Gateway</title>
    <para>The traffic on the VPC private gateway is controlled by creating both ingress and egress
      network ACL rules. The ACLs contains both allow and deny rules. In addition to the default ACL
      rules, rules you might have created are also listed in the ACL drop-down list. As per the
      rule, all the ingress traffic to the private gateway interface and all the egress traffic out
      from the private gateway interface are blocked. You can change this default behaviour while
      creating a private gateway.</para>

  <section id="static-route">
    <title>Creating a Static Route</title>
    <para>&PRODUCT; enables you to specify routing for the VPN connection you create. You can enter
      one or CIDR addresses to indicate which traffic is to be routed back to the gateway.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="blacklist-route">
    <title>Blacklisting Routes</title>
    <para>&PRODUCT; enables you to block a list of routes so that they are not assigned to any of
      the VPC private gateways. Specify the list of routes that you want to blacklist in the
        <code>blacklisted.routes</code> global parameter. Note that the parameter update affects
      only new static route creations. If you block an existing static route, it remains intact and
      continue functioning. You cannot add a static route if the route is blacklisted for the zone.
