  <title>Additional VMX Settings</title>
  <para>A VMX (.vmx) file is the primary configuration file for a virtual machine. When a new VM is
    created, information on the operating system, disk sizes, and networking is stored in this file.
    The VM actively writes to its .vmx file for all the configuration changes. The VMX file is
    typically located in the directory where the VM is created. In Windows Vista / Windows 7 /
    Windows Server 2008, the default location is C:\Users\&lt;your_user_name&gt;\My
    Documents\Virtual Machines\&lt;virtual_machine_name&gt;.vmx. In Linux, vmware-cmd -l lists the
    full path to all the registered VMX files. Any manual additions to the .vmx file from ESX/ESXi
    are overwritten by the entries stored in the vCenter Server database. Therefore, before you edit
    a .vmx file, first remove the VM from the vCenter server's inventory and register the VM again
    after editing.</para>
  <para>The CloudStack API that supports passing some of the VMX settings is registerTemplate. The
    supported parameters are rootDiskController, nicAdapter, and keyboard. In addition to these
    existing VMX parameters, you can now use the keyboard.typematicMinDelay parameter in the
    registerTemplate API call. This parameter controls the amount of delay for the repeated key
    strokes on remote consoles. For more information on keyboard.typematicMinDelay, see <ulink
      url=" http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=196"
