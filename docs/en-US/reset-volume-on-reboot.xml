  <title>Reset VM to New Root Disk on Reboot</title>
  <para>You can specify that you want to discard the root disk and create a new one whenever a given
    VM is rebooted. This is useful for secure environments that need a fresh start on every boot and
    for desktops that should not retain state. The IP address of the VM will not change due to this
    operation.</para>

  <para>When creating a new service offering, set the parameter isVolatile to True. VMs created from
