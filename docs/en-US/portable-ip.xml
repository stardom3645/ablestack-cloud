  <title>About Portable IP</title>
  <para>Portable IPs in &PRODUCT; are nothing but elastic IPs that can be transferred across
    geographically separated zones. As an administrator, you can provision a pool of portable IPs at
    region level and are available for user consumption. The users can acquire portable IPs if admin
    has provisioned portable public IPs at the region level they are part of. These IPs can be use
    for any service within an advanced zone. You can also use portable IPs for EIP service in basic
    zones. Additionally, a portable IP can be transferred from one network to another
    network.</para>
