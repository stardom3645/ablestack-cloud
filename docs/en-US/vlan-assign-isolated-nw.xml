  <title>Assigning VLANs to Isolated Networks</title>
  <para>&PRODUCT; provides you the ability to control VLAN assignment to Isolated networks. You can
    assign a VLAN ID when a network is created, just the way it's done for Shared networks.</para>
  <para>The former behaviour also is supported &mdash; VLAN is randomly allocated to a network from
    the VNET range of the physical network when the network turns to Implemented state. The VLAN is
    released back to the VNET pool when the network shuts down as a part of the Network Garbage
    Collection. The VLAN can be re-used either by the same network when it is implemented again, or
    by any other network. On each subsequent implementation of a network, a new VLAN can be
    assigned.</para>

  <note>
    <para>You cannot change a VLAN once it's assigned to the network. The VLAN remains with the
      network for its entire life cycle.</para>
