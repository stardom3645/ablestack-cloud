    <title>Adding Primary Storage to a KVM hypervisor</title>
    <para>For most Primary Storages there are no special requirements to add primary storage,
               it's all done via the management server.</para>
    <para>The follow subchapters however describe a couple of prerequisites for adding primary storage to a KVM cluster/hypervisor.</para>

    <section id="hypervisor-host-install-primary-storage-nfs">
        <title>Requirements for NFS primary storage</title>
        <para>&PRODUCT; will handle the mounting of the NFS storage, no manual intervention is required.</para>
        <para>Before adding the Primary Storage make sure the NFS client packages are installed. It's always useful to do a manual mount on one or
            more hypervisors prior to adding the primary storage to make sure the mountpoint works.</para>

    <section id="hypervisor-host-install-primary-storage-iscsi">
        <title>Requirements for iSCSI primary storage</title>
        <para>When adding iSCSI Primary Storage the management server of &PRODUCT; will configure the iSCSI initiator. The requirement however is that
            Open-iSCSI is installed on all hypervisors.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section id="hypervisor-host-install-primary-storage-ceph">
        <title>Requirements for Ceph primary storage</title>
        <para>Support for RBD Primary Storage was added in &PRODUCT; 4.0 and requires a special version of libvirt.</para>
        <para>With the KVM hypervisor &PRODUCT; relies on libvirt for handling it's storage pools. Most versions of libvirt
            don't have the RBD storage pool support yet, so a manual compile of libvirt is required.</para>
        <para>To use RBD primary storage make sure you hypervisors meet the following requirements</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>Make sure librbd is installed on your system.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>A RBD-enabled Qemu version is installed</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>Libivrt (>= 0.9.13) with RBD storage pool support enabled is installed</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>No /etc/ceph/ceph.conf configuration file is present on your hypervisors.</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>After meeting these requirements you can add the RBD storage pool via the WebUI.</para>
        <para>Hint: Ubuntu 13.04 meets all these requirements by default.</para>
        <note><para>&PRODUCT; doesn't support multiple hostnames when adding a Primary Storage pool. If you have multiple Ceph monitor daemons
            it's best to create a Round Robin-DNS record and use that as the hostname for the storage pool.</para></note>
