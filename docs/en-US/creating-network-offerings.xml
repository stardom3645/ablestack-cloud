            field appears. Choose the system service offering that you want virtual routers to use
            in this network. For example, if you selected Load Balancer in Supported Services and
            selected a virtual router to provide load balancing, the System Offering field appears
            so you can choose between the &PRODUCT; default system service offering and any custom

            load balancer devices provisioned in the zone. If no sufficient dedicated load balancer
            devices are available in the zone, network creation fails. Dedicated device is a good
            choice for the high-traffic networks that make full use of the device's
            resources.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Shared</emphasis>: If you select shared LB isolation, a shared
            load balancer device is assigned for the network from the pool of shared load balancer
            devices provisioned in the zone. While provisioning &PRODUCT; picks the shared load
            balancer device that is used by the least number of accounts. Once the device reaches

          <para><emphasis role="bold">Inline mode</emphasis>: Supported only for Juniper SRX
            firewall and BigF5 load balancer devices. In inline mode, a firewall device is placed in
            front of a load balancing device. The firewall acts as the gateway for all the incoming
            traffic, then redirect the load balancing traffic to the load balancer behind it. The
            load balancer in this case will not have the direct access to the public network. </para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Side by Side</emphasis>: In side by side mode, a firewall
            device is deployed in parallel with the load balancer device. So the traffic to the load
            balancer public IP is not routed through the firewall, and therefore, is exposed to the
            public network.</para>

            Virtual Router is selected as the Source NAT provider. Select this option if you want to
            use two virtual routers in the network for uninterrupted connection: one operating as
            the master virtual router and the other as the backup. The master virtual router
            receives requests from and sends responses to the user’s VM. The backup virtual router
            is activated only when the master is down. After the failover, the backup becomes the
            master virtual router. &PRODUCT; deploys the routers on different hosts to ensure

            starts in the network. When conservative mode is off, the public IP can only be used for
            a single service. For example, a public IP used for a port forwarding rule cannot be
            used for defining other services, such as StaticNAT or load balancing. When the conserve
            mode is on, you can define more than one service on the same public IP.</para>

            <para>If StaticNAT is enabled, irrespective of the status of the conserve mode, no port
              forwarding or load balancing rule can be created for the IP. However, you can add the
