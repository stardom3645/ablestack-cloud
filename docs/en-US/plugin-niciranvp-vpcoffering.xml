    <title>VPC Offering with Nicira NVP</title>
    <para>To allow a VPC to use the Nicira NVP plugin to provision networks, a new VPC offering needs to be created which allows the Virtual Networking service to be implemented by NiciraNVP.</para>
    <para>This is not currently possible with the UI. The API does provide the proper calls to create a VPC offering with Virtual Networking enabled. However due to a limitation in the 4.1 API it is not possible to select the provider for this network service. To configure the VPC offering with the NiciraNVP provider edit the database table 'vpc_offering_service_map' and change the provider to NiciraNvp for the service 'Connectivity'</para>
    <para>It is also possible to update the default VPC offering by adding a row to the
        'vpc_offering_service_map' with service 'Connectivity' and provider 'NiciraNvp'</para>
