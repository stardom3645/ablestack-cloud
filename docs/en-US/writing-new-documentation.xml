    <title>Writing &PRODUCT; Documentation</title>
    <para>&PRODUCT; documentation is written in DocBook xml format. Each guide defined with a publican configuration file refers to a DocBook <emphasis>book</emphasis>.</para> 
    <para>These books are defined in xml files in docs/en-US, for instance if we look at the Developers guide, its configuration file contains:</para>
    <programlisting>
        xml_lang: en-US
        type: Book
        docname: Developers_Guide
        brand: cloudstack
        chunk_first: 1
        chunk_section_depth: 1
    </programlisting>
    <para>The <emphasis>docname</emphasis> key gives you the basename of the DocBook file located in the en-US directory that contains the description of the book.</para>
    <para>Looking closely at Developers_Guide.xml we see that it contains <emphasis>book</emphasis> tags and several references to other xml files. These are the chapters of the book, currently they are:</para>

    <para>All these xml files are written in DocBook format.</para>
    <note>
        <para>DocBook format is well <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/docbook.html">documented</ulink>, refer to the documentation for any questions about DocBook tags</para>
    </note>
    <para>When writing documentation, you therefore need to located the book,chapter and section of the content you want to write/correct.
    Or create a new book,chapter,section.</para>
    <para>You will then learn much more about DocBook tagging. In order to write this chapter about documentation, I added the <emphasis>working-with-documentation.xml</emphasis>file describing a chapter in the Developer book and I created several sections within that chapter like so:</para>
    <programlisting>
    <![CDATA[
        <chapter id="working-with-documentation">
            <title>Preparing and Building &PRODUCT; Documentation</title>
            <para>This chapter describes how to install publican, how to write new documentation and build a guide as well as how to build a translated version of the documentation using transifex</para>
            <xi:include href="installing-publican.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
            <xi:include href="building-documentation.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
            <xi:include href="writing-new-documentation.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
            <xi:include href="building-translation.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
        </chapter>
    ]]>
    </programlisting>

    <para>Note the id witin the chapter tag, it represents the basename of the xml file describing the chapter.</para>
    <para>For translation purposes it is important that this basename be less than 50 characters long.</para>

    <para>This chapter also refers to xml files which contains each section. While you could embed the sections directly in the chapter file and as a matter of fact also write the chapters within a single book file. Breaking things up in smaller files at the granularity of the section, allows us to re-use any section to build different books.</para>
    <para>For completeness here is an example of a section:</para>
    <programlisting>
    <![CDATA[
        <section id="building-documentation">
            <title>Building &PRODUCT; Documentation</title>
            <para>To build a specific guide, go to the source tree of the documentation in /docs and identify the guide you want to build.</para>
            <para>Currenlty there are four guides plus the release notes, all defined in publican configuration files:</para>
            <programlisting>
               publican-adminguide.cfg
               publican-devguide.cfg
               publican-installation.cfg
               publican-plugin-niciranvp.cfg
               publican-release-notes.cfg
            </programlisting>
            <para>To build the Developer guide for example, do the following:</para>
            <programlisting>publican build --config=publican-devguide.cfg --formats=pdf --langs=en-US</programlisting>
            <para>A pdf file will be created in tmp/en-US/pdf, you may choose to build the guide in a different format like html. In that case just replace the format value.</para>
        </section>
