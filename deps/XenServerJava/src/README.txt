XenServerJava
=============

NOTE: This is a modified version of Citrix XenServer's SDK. This version of 
XenServerJava includes some customization which is required to make it work
with CloudStack.


Version 6.2.0-1.

XenServerJava is a complete SDK for Citrix XenServer, exposing the XenServer
API as Java classes.

For XenServer documentation, see http://docs.xensource.com.
XenServerJava includes a class for every XenServer class, and a method for
each XenServer API call, so API documentation and examples written for
for other languages will apply equally well to Java.
In particular, the SDK Guide and API Documentation are ideal for developers
wishing to use XenServerJava.

Network at http://community.citrix.com/cdn/xs.

XenServerJava is free sofware.  You can redistribute and modify it under the
terms of the BSD license.  See LICENSE.txt for details.

Dependencies
------------

XenServerJava is dependent upon Apache XML-RPC and WS-Commons, both by The
Apache Software Foundation.  We would like to thank the ASF and the
Apache XML-RPC development team in particular.
Both are licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0; see

We test with version 3.1 of Apache XML-RPC, and version 1.0.2 of WS-Commons.
We recommend that you use these versions, though others may work.
